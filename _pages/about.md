I'm a final year student at [SRM Institute Of Science and Technology](https://www.srmist.edu.in), pursuing an undergraduate major in Computer Science and Engineering. Previously, I was a Visiting International Student at the [University of Wiconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu) for Fall 2023.

I was a MITACS Globalink Research Intern for Summer 2024 in the [Dumeaux Lab](https://lab-dumeaux.science), at the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, at the [University of Western Ontario (Western University)](https://www.uwo.ca). Prior to that I worked as a Research Assistant in the [Solis-Lemus Lab](https://solislemuslab.github.io) at the [Wisconsin Institute of Discovery](https://wid.wisc.edu) at the Univeristy of Wisconsin-Madison. I have also been a part of a GenAI startup, [Tune AI](https://tunehq.ai), for over 1.5 years, as an Engineering Intern.

My field of interest is everything Large Language Models. Solving biases in LLMs, applications of LLMs in everyday use-cases, and building around LLMs for optimised inference.

Apart from professional interests, I really like music and football. Some of my most controversial opinions are, Reddit is the best social-media app and Tyler the Creator is a musical genius.
